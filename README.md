# Azure: Create a Virtual Machine and Deploy a Web-Server

## Objective

The objective of this projcet is to learn how to securely deploy and manage resources in Azure. The work will be focused on learning the fundamental networking architecture in Azure by creating Virtual Networks, Subnets, Network Security Groups, and Virtual Machines. I'll also be learning how to use Azure Bastion to securely connect to a Linux machine via SSH, install a web server, and configure it to be accessible via a public IP and custom DNS label. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps

- Create a Resource Group
  Log in to the Azure Portal and select "Create a Resource"
  Search for Resource Group and once found, click create
  Give it a name in order to find it later. I'll name it RG-USE-Nextcloud. RG-Resource Group, USE-US East Region, Nextcloud-for nextcloud server

- Create a Virtual Network and a subnet

- Protect a subnet using a Network Security Group

- Deploy Bastion to connect to a Virtual Machine

- Create an Ubuntu Server Virtual Machine

- Install Nextcloud by connecting via SSH using Bastion

- Publish an IP

- Create a DNS label
